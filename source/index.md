# What is Apollo Optics?

Apollo Optics is a tool that provides usage and performance insights into your GraphQL service. Apollo Optics is delivered as a cloud-based, software-as-a-service application to be used in conjunction with an installable GraphQL server agent.

Optics currently supports all Javascript GraphQL servers, Rails applications that use the [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) gem, and the Relay or Apollo Client.
