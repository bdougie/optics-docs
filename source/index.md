# What is Apollo Optics?

Apollo Optics is a tool that provides usage and performance insights for your GraphQL API. While GraphQL lets you write any queries you want, Optics helps you to optimize them.

It is a cloud-based, software-as-a-service application that uses an open source agent to instrument your GraphQL servers.

You can use Apollo Optics to trace how your queries run, identify performance trends, understand how your API is used, and find the time to resolution, among other things.
