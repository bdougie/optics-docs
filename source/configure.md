title: Configuring an endpoint
order: 0

In Optics, create a new endpoint and then follow the in-application configuration instructions. A GraphQL endpoint usually consists of multiple GraphQL server instances that all share the same app key.

You must add our agent to your GraphQL application in order for Optics to receive performance and analytics information regarding your queries and resolvers.

Optics currently supports all Javascript GraphQL servers, Rails applications that use the [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) gem, and Relay or Apollo Client.

Detailed instructions for your specific environment can be found below:
