Optics offers beta support for Ruby GraphQL servers! The Ruby agent is currently in beta and _not_ recommended for production use.

# Using Optics with a Ruby Server

1. Create an Optics account by navigating over to http://optics.apollodata.com/ and signing in with your Github credentials.
2. Within Optics, create a ‘service’ to obtain an API key that you’ll use to configure the agent.
3. Head over to https://github.com/apollostack/optics-agent-ruby and follow the instructions to add the agent to your application's Ruby GraphQL server. 
4. Once you have the agent integrated into a running application, make some queries in your application then head back over to http://optics.apollodata.com/ to checkout timing/usage information.

If you hit any issues or have feedback with the Ruby agent, please email us at optics-support@apollodata.com.
