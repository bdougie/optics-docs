# Using Github Organizations

Upon logging in for the first time, Optics will ask you which Github Organizations you would like to provide access to Optics for. Optics will then create one Optics account for each Github Organization that you provide access for.
We use Github’s OAuth service for read-only organization information. Optics won’t have access to your source code or other sensitive data

When you sign in to Optics, you will have access to each account owned by a Github organization you are in. Use the organization account picker to switch accounts.

If another member of the Github organization has already signed up the Github organization for Optics access, then you will have access to that existing Optics account.

# Billing

Each account is given a 2 week Free trial to start with. Go to the Account home page `optics.apollodata.com/account/<account_name> to start the trial.

Once the 2 week trial is over, you can continue using Optics with a paid Optics plan. Select an Optics plan and provide a payment method for the account.

Each account has it's own payment method and associated plan.

# Cancel an account

You can cancel an account by contacting Optics Support. Cancelling an account will disable the services configured to use that account, and will delete data from the account's services. Cancelling an account will remove that account for all other Github members in the organization that owns that account.
