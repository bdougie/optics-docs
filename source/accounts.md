# Using Github Organizations

Upon logging in for the first time, Optics will ask you which Github Organizations you'd like for Optics to be able to access. Optics will then create one Optics account for each Github Organization for which it has permissions.

Github’s OAuth service is used for read-only organization information. Optics won’t have access rights to your source code or to any other sensitive data.

When you sign in to Optics, you will have access to each account owned by a Github organization you are in. Use the organization account picker to switch accounts.

# Collaboration

If another member of a Github organization you belong to has already signed up the Github organization for Optics access, you'll have access to that existing Optics account.

If you'd like to work with additional team members, and you are the admin of a Github organization, simply add them to your Github organization.

If you signed up using a personal Github account and would now like to give someone else Optics access, you'll need to set up a new account, with a payment method added, for the new Github organization. When the account is set up, contact Optics Support to start a paid subscription on the new account, and cancel the subscription on the old account.
