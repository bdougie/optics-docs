# Billing

Each Optics account starts at the free tier, which gives you up to 10,000 queries a month.

If you exceed the 10,000 monthly volume limit, you'll need to upgrade. You can continue using Optics by providing a payment method for your account and signing up for a paid Optics plan. Note that each account has a separate payment method and associated plan.

As your request volume grows we will automatically upgrade you to the next tier.

To receive copies of past invoices, use the form or email <a href="mailto:support@meteor.com">support@meteor.com</a> with your request.

# Cancellation

You can cancel your account by contacting Optics Support. Canceling an account will disable the services configured to use that account, and delete all data from those services. Canceling an account will also remove that account for all other Github members in the organization still using the account.
